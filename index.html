Welcome to my minesweeper game! <br>
Grey tiles are unselected <br>
Red tiles are flagged - Shift Click to flag <br>
Black tiles are activated bombs, or bombs displayed at the end of the game <br>
White means it's a safe tile <br>
You can click on a revealed space to reveal all squares around it, don't worry, it doesn't reveal mines that are flagged!
